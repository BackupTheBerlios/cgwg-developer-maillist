<PRE>Hi Mathias,

Thanks for the comments. I try to answer your questions below.

Quoting Mathias Dalheimer &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/cgwg-developer">dalheimer at itwm.fhg.de</A>&gt;:

&gt;<i> &gt; The scheduler which I am
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working on is a higher-level look-ahead &quot;metascheduler&quot;, which tries to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; schedule full workflows in advance. So if I had to put my scheduler into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the sequence above, I would put it as a source of the workflow
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; description (MY_SCHEDULER -&gt; workflow description -&gt; ...), what is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consistent with you definition of the workflow module (&quot;it integrates a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workflow description as it would occur as the user's input&quot;), with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; exception that it makes also scheduling decisions at the same time. Of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course, the workflow module would be separated from the meta-scheduler.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In that case, the sequence would be as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GENERATOR (only sequential jobs) -&gt; WORKFLOW MODULE or alternatively MY
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SCHEDULER -&gt; YOUR SCHEDULER -&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the output of your scheduler is a submission list of jobs? How does
</I>&gt;<i> this work? Do you rely on another scheduler? I would have expected the
</I>&gt;<i> following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GENERATOR -&gt; WORKFLOW MODULE -&gt; workload description -&gt; YOUR SCHEDULER
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; scheduling log -&gt; ANALYSIS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The point here is that my scheduler is not integrated with any simulator, and
relies on an underlying environment even more than yours. I would say that it
is a &quot;workflow-oriented&quot; scheduler rather than a &quot;workload-oriented&quot; one. I
mean here that a single scheduler instance is responsible for scheduling of a
single workflow, being not aware of the other background workload being
generated on the Grid.
 In this case, I can imagine that my scheduler generates some workload which
would be subsequently processed by another scheduler (for instance yours)
without changing main mapping decisions. The output from your
scheduler/simulator would give me all information which I need. Analysis of the
output from my scheduler would not allow me to evaluate my scheduling properly,
since it does not consider the external load which can affect the execution.
 I would think about my scheduler as an [optional] part of the workflow module.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From my point of view, it would be important to be able to be use my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scheduler instead of the workflow module. In that case, the scheduling
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be done for some of the jobs already on this stage. Your scheduler
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would not change these decisions, but only would take them into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consideration and include them to the scheduling log. It that way, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would have opportunity to evaluate my scheduling, by evaluating your logs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me know if I misunderstood something about your approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This depends on the following: If your scheduler depends on a low-level
</I>&gt;<i> scheduler, this is fine. But I could also imagine that your replace my
</I>&gt;<i> scheduler with whatever implementation you want, e.g. a maui in
</I>&gt;<i> simulation mode. The workload generator should just be a piece of
</I>&gt;<i> software that generates workload files with different load levels. These
</I>&gt;<i> files can then be reused as input to any other system (which probably
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be wrapped in a parser...). It should be independent of the way
</I>&gt;<i> people evaluate their schedulers (using simulations, or using a real
</I>&gt;<i> production environment where they inject the workload jobs).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The situation in my group is the following: the scheduler is a part of a bigger
system, and produces schedules for a real execution engine. I'm not really
happy to be so strictly dependent on the real production environment, because
it limits my activities and does not allow me to evaluate my scheduler
properly. Therefore, I like very much the idea of developing a more generic
workflow representation which can be accepted by your environment and by my
scheduler at the same time. As you wrote, it would make me independent of the
underlying environment, and would allow me to test my scheduler more properly.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not at the moment, but this will be an issue sooner or later. I am not
</I>&gt;<i> sure how to model this yet: The scheduler's decisions may change the
</I>&gt;<i> network load during the simulation. Therefore, we would need a way of
</I>&gt;<i> keeping the current network state during the simulation available and
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic. I am thinking of having a communication between the network
</I>&gt;<i> simulator (probably ns-2) and my scheduler simulation:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---------   -- current network load info ---&gt;	-------------
</I>&gt;<i> | ns-2  |                                       | calana    |
</I>&gt;<i> ---------   &lt;--- change in network usage ----   -------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I am not sure whether this should be part of the workload description
</I>&gt;<i> or another little program that can be configured. If you have any ideas
</I>&gt;<i> on this, I would love to hear them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
AFAIK, the problem here is that ns-2 does not work in an interactive mode, but
rather in a batch mode. It allows to define a static network situation and
simulate the trafic in such environment. However, we can think together about
possible integration and prepare a draft solution for the ns-2 workshop this
year.

I'll try to spend some time learning how to use your tool. I'll let you know if
I have any other ideas.

cheers,
Marek
