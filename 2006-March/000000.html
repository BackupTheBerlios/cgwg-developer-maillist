<PRE>Hi Marek,

I uploaded a new version yesterday - it is capable of creating 
coallocation jobs (&quot;multijob&quot; in the XML schema). Now, I want to deal 
with the configuration of the workload (what resources, how many, ...). 
BTW: I think we will provide a Java JAXB parser for the files soon.

But back to your questions/comments...

OK, thank you. I'll CC you directly just in case the mailing list 
doesn't work (its the first eMail on it).

&gt;<i> Now I'll try to answer your questions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If I understood your correctly, the way how you use your generator is as

</I>&gt;<i> GENERATOR -&gt; workload description -&gt; YOUR SCHEDULER -&gt; schedule -&gt; YOUR

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If this is true, than we are probably thinking about two different

</I>
Correct. Think of it as a kind of multi-site cluster scheduler with 
matchmaking capabilities. But I would draw your picture this way:

GENERATOR -&gt; workload description -&gt; SCHEDULER-SIMULATOR -&gt; scheduling 
log -&gt; YOUR ANALYSIS SCRIPT

We basically developed a standalone version of my scheduler just for 
simulation purposes.

&gt;<i> The scheduler which I am
</I>&gt;<i> working on is a higher-level look-ahead &quot;metascheduler&quot;, which tries to
</I>&gt;<i> schedule full workflows in advance. So if I had to put my scheduler into
</I>&gt;<i> the sequence above, I would put it as a source of the workflow
</I>&gt;<i> description (MY_SCHEDULER -&gt; workflow description -&gt; ...), what is
</I>&gt;<i> consistent with you definition of the workflow module (&quot;it integrates a
</I>&gt;<i> workflow description as it would occur as the user's input&quot;), with the
</I>&gt;<i> exception that it makes also scheduling decisions at the same time. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course, the workflow module would be separated from the meta-scheduler.
</I>&gt;<i> In that case, the sequence would be as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> GENERATOR (only sequential jobs) -&gt; WORKFLOW MODULE or alternatively MY
</I>&gt;<i> SCHEDULER -&gt; YOUR SCHEDULER -&gt; 
</I>
So the output of your scheduler is a submission list of jobs? How does 
this work? Do you rely on another scheduler? I would have expected the 
following:

GENERATOR -&gt; WORKFLOW MODULE -&gt; workload description -&gt; YOUR SCHEDULER 
-&gt; scheduling log -&gt; ANALYSIS

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So my idea for the generator is at the moment like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.The generator receives some input. The input includes description of
</I>&gt;<i> some workflows.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.The generator generates the workload. Some tasks in the workload are
</I>&gt;<i> in fact workflow references.
</I>&gt;<i> 3.The workflow module replaces the workflow references with full
</I>&gt;<i> workflow descriptions. The result is represented in a uniform way
</I>&gt;<i> (extended standard workload model).
</I>&gt;<i> 4.Your scheduler takes the output from the generator, and does what it
</I>&gt;<i> was doing so far.
</I>
Fine with me.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From my point of view, it would be important to be able to be use my
</I>&gt;<i> scheduler instead of the workflow module. In that case, the scheduling
</I>&gt;<i> would be done for some of the jobs already on this stage. Your scheduler
</I>&gt;<i> would not change these decisions, but only would take them into
</I>&gt;<i> consideration and include them to the scheduling log. It that way, I
</I>&gt;<i> would have opportunity to evaluate my scheduling, by evaluating your logs.
</I>&gt;<i> Let me know if I misunderstood something about your approach.
</I>
This depends on the following: If your scheduler depends on a low-level 
scheduler, this is fine. But I could also imagine that your replace my 
scheduler with whatever implementation you want, e.g. a maui in 
simulation mode. The workload generator should just be a piece of 
software that generates workload files with different load levels. These 
files can then be reused as input to any other system (which probably 
needs to be wrapped in a parser...). It should be independent of the way 
people evaluate their schedulers (using simulations, or using a real 
production environment where they inject the workload jobs).

&gt;<i> Network traffic is another issue. Simple network traffic generation
</I>&gt;<i> would be a rather simple task. IMHO, if we want to fully consider
</I>&gt;<i> workflows in your model, your simulator should also consider network
</I>&gt;<i> traffic simulation. ns-2 requires a concrete case (network
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure + scheduled data transfers) to be defined, and then it
</I>&gt;<i> simulates the traffic. My colleague even suggested to apply a simpler
</I>&gt;<i> simulation method (for instance a so-called TCP equation) to simulate
</I>&gt;<i> the traffic, which is sufficient in most of the cases. Let me know if
</I>&gt;<i> you plan to consider network traffic in your simulator.
</I>
Not at the moment, but this will be an issue sooner or later. I am not 
sure how to model this yet: The scheduler's decisions may change the 
network load during the simulation. Therefore, we would need a way of 
keeping the current network state during the simulation available and 
dynamic. I am thinking of having a communication between the network 
simulator (probably ns-2) and my scheduler simulation:


---------   -- current network load info ---&gt;	-------------
|<i> ns-2  |                                       | calana    |
</I>---------   &lt;--- change in network usage ----   -------------

So I am not sure whether this should be part of the workload description 
or another little program that can be configured. If you have any ideas 
on this, I would love to hear them.

&gt;<i> Answering your question about the &quot;multiprogramming level for the 
</I>&gt;<i> scheduler&quot;, I meant here how many jobs can be scheduled at the same time
</I>&gt;<i> on the same CPU (just one or also more). But maybe this is out of scope
</I>&gt;<i> of your model.
</I>
Ah, ok. Yes, this is currently out of scope. But it can easily be added 
to the workload generator.

&gt;<i> Let me know what you think about all these ideas. In the meanwhile, I
</I>&gt;<i> will read the documentation of your tool, when it appears on the project
</I>&gt;<i> webpage.
</I>
Uhh, it is dangerous to wait for the documentation ;-) I need to get the 
API documentation complete. But the script is so simple that you may 
want to check the workloadgen.rb file.

Cheers,
Mathias
